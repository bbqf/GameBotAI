## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

## Notes

- Clarifications resolved per user choices:
  - Q1 (Name uniqueness): Names can be non-unique; UI disambiguates.
  - Q2 (Delete behavior): Hard delete is blocked when referenced; require unlink/migrate.
  - Q3 (Permissions): All authenticated users may perform destructive actions with confirmation.

- Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan`.
